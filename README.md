Hi there,

I am Arjun Surendran, and I work at Adobe as a On-Device Machine Learning Engineer. My job mainly include working with native inference frameworks such as CoreML, Tensorflow Lite, WinML, OpenVino for mobile, desktop and cloud. I create cross-platform apis that natively work with these frameworks for optimized machine learning in the targeted platform. By cross-platform, I mean MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android. My goto languages at work are C++, and Python.

When I am not working I love reading, and learning about new things. I am really curious about Machine Learning, Systems Programming and Programming languages.
